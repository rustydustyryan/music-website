            <h1>The <span class="music-color">Why</span></h1>
            <p>If you are like me then you're tired of giant corporations and their greedy antics. Spotify and Apple Music are sucking the life out of the artists they literally rely on for their business by paying them next to nothing, while also forcing the artists to pay made up middlemen like DistroKid to host their music; and obviously Spotify and Apple Music get a cut. The streaming tycoons cater to the rich, popular artists (and pay them much better rates, as if that needs to be said...), and leave the lesser-known artists to scrounge for fractions of a penny per stream. I could go on, but I won't. The fact is that I'm sick of them and I want to put my attention and money elswhere. That is why I have created this website, to give people a place where good music is celebrated!</p>

          <div class="aside-container">
            <div class="aside-1">
              <p>Eventually I want to expand this idea and start paying the artists that I feature. Maybe I could feature a single artist every week and give them a bit more spotlight and showcase a whole album or just a few songs they are particularly proud of.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="aside-2">
              <p>Let me know if you have any artists or songs that I should be excited about, as well as ideas for growing this website and support for artists.</p>
              <br>
              <p><strong>I would love to hear from you.</strong></p>
