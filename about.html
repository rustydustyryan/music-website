            <h1>The <span class="music-color">Why</span></h1>
            <p>If you are like me then you're tired of giant corporations making obscene amounts of money while their customers, the general public and the environment have a terrible time. The popular music streaming companies are no different. Independent artists are paid basically nothing when their songs get played, and are even charged to upload thier music to third party distribution websites that seemingly serve no purpose besides adding another pay wall. The musicians could easily upload their music directly to the streaming site, which would make the distribution "services" obsolete... These bloated companies obviously don't care about the art or the artists they rely on for their business; I would rather put my attention and money elswhere. That is why I have created this website, to give people a place where good music and passionate artists are celebrated!</p>

          <div class="aside-container">
            <div class="aside-1">
              <p>Eventually I want to expand this idea and start paying the artists that I feature. But for now I will contribute with exposure and hopefully additional enthusiastic fans. I would love it if you treated this site like your weekly discover playlist instead of supporting the streaming tycoons.</p>

              <p>Send me a message if you know of any artists or songs that we should be excited about, as well as ideas for growing this website and how to better support artists.</p>
